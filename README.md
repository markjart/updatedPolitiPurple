# PolitiPurple 
## For every news story there is an equal and opposite news story

In this age of siloed thought people often stick to their _tried-and-true **confirms my beliefs** news sources_ with nary a thought, nor even an inkling of concern, for what the **other side** may have to say about the same subject.  But what if you are not inclined to be **just RED (Conservative)** or **just BLUE (Liberal)** in your thoughts and opinions?  

What if you pull from both the left and the right?  Would it be fair to say that you are **purple** in your politics?

We think so! That's why we built **PolitiPurple** - One location for you to find news articles about the subjects that matter to you from both the Left and the Right side of the political spectrum.


Chances are you have to spend time navigating across multiple news sites trying to find articles about the subjects that matter to you.
