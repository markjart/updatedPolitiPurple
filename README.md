## For every news story there is an equal and opposite news story

In this age of siloed thought people often stick to their _tried-and-true, **it confirms my beliefs** news sources_ with nary a thought, nor even an inkling of concern, for what the **other side** may have to say about the same subject.  But what if you are not inclined to be **just RED (Conservative)** or **just BLUE (Liberal)** in your thoughts and opinions?  

## Welcome to PolitiPurple!
