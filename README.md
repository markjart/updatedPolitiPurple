## For every news story there is an equal and opposite news story

In this age of siloed thought people often stick to their _tried-and-true, **it confirms my beliefs** news sources_ with nary a thought, nor even an inkling of concern, for what the **other side** may have to say about the same subject.  But what if you are not inclined to be **just RED (Conservative)** or **just BLUE (Liberal)** in your thoughts and opinions?  

## Welcome to PolitiPurple!

One location for you to find news articles about the subjects that matter to you from both the Left and the Right side of the political spectrum.  We assembled our news sources and paired them with our best estimate as to an opposite news source based on the article, "[The Chart, Version 3.0: What, Exactly, Are We Reading?](https://www.allgeneralizationsarefalse.com/the-chart-version-3-0-what-exactly-are-we-reading/)".

Liberal (Blue) Sources | Conservative (Red) Sources

The Washington Post | Time Magazine
CNN | The Economist
The Guardian UK | The Hill
The Huffington Post | The Wall Street Journal
MSNBC | Fox News
BuzzFeed | Breitbart News
